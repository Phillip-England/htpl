# HTPL
What if HTML was a programming language? With Javascript, we can *extend* HTML. What will happen if we really press this idea?

## Inspiration
Two of my favorite tools revolve around HTML's attributes. Both Tailwind and HTMX center on this idea of extracting data from attributes and doing something special with it. I believe more can be sqeezed out of this idea.
